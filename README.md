# Python-PDFtoWordLayout
This Python script converts a PDF into a Word document, extracting both text and images. It uses PyMuPDF to extract content and python-docx to generate the Word file. The text is added to a table, and any images are inserted into the second column, preserving the layout of the original PDF.
